Old-school hip hop (also spelled old skool) is a term that describes the earliest commercially recorded hip hop music. It typically refers to music created around 1979. Old-school hip hop is said to have ended around 1984, due to changes in both rapping technique and the accompanying music and rhythms.
The image, styles and sounds of old-school hip hop were exemplified by figures like Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Kool Herc, Treacherous Three, Funky Four Plus One, Kurtis Blow, The Sugarhill Gang, Melle Mel, Super-Wolf,, West Street Mob Spoonie Gee, Kool Moe Dee, Busy Bee Starski, Lovebug Starski, The Cold Crush Brothers
The release of The Message in 1982 by Duke Bootee (who did nearly half the rapping and the rest by Melle Mel) and Melle Mel, although released as by Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five, marked the arrival of hip hop as social commentary, making it possible for future artists like Public Enemy and N.W.A to create an identity based on socially conscious themes in later years. The most popular rappers from those days are N.W.A., The Wu-Tang Clan, Ice Cube, Eazy-E, Run-DMC, Dr. Dre, and many other pioneers. If not for old-school rappers, it's highly unlikely that rap would have evolved into the popular artform that it is today. Many old-school rappers are still widely respected by today's biggest hip hop artists and fans.
